if you want interact with windows to another windows server. Observe we have 2 different 
windows system, make sure there is one API interacting here as IQ service.developed by 
.net api with integrate with active directory

AD user and group available .
Make sure we have to install IQ service to active director this is 3rd party tools. 
Test connection failed. Ad server was not running. 
I research in SailPoint community I got to know that IQ service is not running into active 
directory server.i started IQ service and click on test connection I was working then 
Make sure IQ service version and SailPoint version should match.
