1)Diffrence between work groups and populations?

Groups — used to track accessibility, activity, and monitored risk by group membership. Risk 
scores aredisplayed on the Home Page. Groups are defined automatically by values assigned to identity 
attributes.
Populations — are query based groups created from the results of searches run from the 
Identity Search page. Searches that result in interesting populations of identities can, optionally, be saved as 
populations for reuse within IdentityIQ.

Populations are similar to groups, except that they are driven off of multiple search criteria
whereas Groups are statically defined based off a single Identity attribute.
These group themselves are not dynamic. You must run the Refresh Groups task
periodically to update them. Between runs of Refresh Groups, the groups themselves
remain static, but the membership is always based off a dynamic query.

Note: Populations are dynamic queries, so every time you view a population, you
are viewing its current members at that point in time

2)difference between groups and workgroups.

Workgroups: it like a box, we can randomly add random user to workgroup like create a group of users. 
Group of people from job title like developer,QA 
associate sets of Identities to facilitate sharing of IdentityIQ responsibilities; responsibilities may include 
Certification reviews and Application or Entitlement ownership, among others.
Groups: based on attribute we can create group like location USA
sets of Identities created based on the value of a single Identity Attribute; used as a filter on the set of 
Identities included in atask, Certification, or report
