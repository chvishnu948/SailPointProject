connector
Application

Application and Connector are linked to each other in one to one relationship.

Connector (Custom cnnector development)

Policy :- rules to maintain segregation of duties
	
SOD

Complaince :- these are set of rules which a compay needed to follow when ever any action happens in the firm

Sailpoint identityIq --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->Target system(AD)
                     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->Target system(Exchange)
                     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->Target system(Oracle/JDBC/Flatefile/HR Source)

===========================      ============================
----Governar Complaince---       life cycle manage component-----------> Proviging Module
==========================       =============================



partitioned aggregation:- its aggregation fast to bring all data from target system
ex:-4 diff identityiq installed in my company
    each instance of identityiq can process 25k accounts


delta aggregation:- Delta aggregation means try to bring only those accounts which has changed on your target system.

till 6.3 version only two object type were there
1) Account
2) Group -Entitlemet in Identityiq

from  6.4 version multi object consept / group consept
1) Account
2) Role
3) Profile
4)Privaliges


Entitlement:-  Access of the target system which can be assinged to end user.

Department is something which we can gran a new user. It meas department is kind of access in myimplementence.

All access of target system should come into identityiq in from of enetitlemet and it sould be populate in entittlement catolog.

To bring all enetitlemet / access from target system , the job which is run called account group aggregation.
Application onboarding:-
------------------------
  -->Account aggregation-->the terms which is relates to bringing all accounts from target system into identityiq repository

By default 80 targeted to be connected using out of box connectors provided by sailpointiq	

Q)Entitlement :- It is access to target system and its assinged to end users.

Q2)what is correlation :-To find an identity for an account based on some attribute of account and identity is called correlation

Task:-2
------
Q1)what is connector?
Q2)what is application onboarding?
Q3)
Q4)
Task:-3
-------
Q1)Diff b/w identity and account?
Q2)What is authoretive source?
Q3)what is managed attributes?
Q4)what does promote managed attribute task to do?
Q5)what is entitlement?what is entitlement catalog?
Q6)what is relationship b/w entitlement and target system?
Q7)what diff b/w account aggregation and group aggregation?


 customizationRule:-Its also call resours object. when we bring the accounts from target system 
                     its converted data in resource object here we can customized account like static or dynamic both are we can do
					 ex:-static--> object.put("empType", "contractor");
					                 reurn object;
						 dynamic-->we getting firstname and lastname for create fullname
						           object.put("fullName","fullName');
					               reurn object;
								  
								  
          Build Map rule                                   customization
	
1)It is a connector rule  .                            1) aggregation rule.
2)tis rule can do whatever customization rule         2)this rule can not do what things build map rule can do.
  can do.
3)connection to the target system is exposed          3)You can not connect to the target system using customization Rule.
   in build map rule.
   
Provisioning in sailpoint:-
---------------------------
CRUD - Create, update(modify,update,password chage,unlock,disable,enable) and delete

Flat file (HR connectors) - generally does not provide provisioing
Not all connector provides provisioning feature.

Application xml from debug page,(FeatureString) - Provision.

Provisioning Engine - create provisioningPlan - which is in turn is sent to respective connector  ---
--- connector reads to provisioingplane ---- create a script /query out of the content present in plan 
--- the query or the script create by connector is run on target system using APIs
--- Returned result is sent back in to iiq server

Structure of a simple provisioning plan 
either plan stored in form of json or in form of xml


ProvisioningPlan
AccountRequest 
AttributeRequest

Sailpoint context is a accesble in rule using a variable is calledcontext.

Authentication - proove who are you.
authorization mechanism - bassicaly permision given to restric access of a user on a particular system.

roles --> bassicaly permision given to restric access of a user on a particular target system.
capabilities --> bassicaly permision given to restric access of a user on perticular user interface of identityIq.
scope --> bassicaly permision given to restric access of a user on a perticular objects in sailpoint.

1)Role in sailpoint--(what is entitlement) Target system access which is pulled in sailpoint using account group aggregation task.
                     To bundle one or more entitlement in single object is called role.
					 
Role is sailpoint
Type
1)Entitlement--can be assined to end user
2)IT   --role --can't be assined to end user
3)Business--role --can be assined to end user
4)Organization--role--can't be assined to end user

Group in sailpoint -- collection of identity.

groups -> collection of identity based on groupfactory.
population--> collection identity based on some search result. The attribute which is result in population are either group factory or any searchble attribute.
workgroup--> manual collection of identity. 


policy --policy are set of rules which guranty SOD in firm.

SOD -- Seggrigation Of Duties(if a person is authorized to do development job he must do development job only should not do managerial job ).

vishnu --developer
         Qa
		 
Developer can not have a QA access - policy of firm.

violance -- when ever the policy not met.it rises a conflict of access its turned as a policy violance.

resolution of a policy violance

1)manually remove  conflict of access.
2)cerify the identity which as conflict of access.
3)Allow the violance for certian period of time.

policy checks are done two ways
1) preactive check policy -(LCM provisioning workflow
2) reactive policy check (Refresh identity cube task)


1)Role --is an enity which is strictly associated with identityiq .Role is a grouping of enetitlemet.
2)Entitlement -- are mainly enties which associated with target system . Entitlement can be a group of target system permisions.

Type of policy:-
 

account violation:- 
jdbc db system.

vishnu(read access on employee_salary_table).
hacker
vishnu(write access on employee_salary_table).
If there are two accounts of same identity on same target system then raise a violance.


Risk:- The level of vulnarablity associate with each identity.(entity)


vishnu
access to read file 

read access on personal details file--risk level 0.
read access on finacial details file --risk level 800.

workflow - sequence of steps

workflow are sequence of steps which are followed in case some events happends in sailpoint.
 
events - a person joining the firm. a person leaving from firm,Deportment of a person change, clicking on some quicklink presnt in sailpoint. 

Java class                                                          workflow
    Functions                                                            steps
